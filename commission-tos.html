								<li><font color="black">Process</li></font>
						</ul>
							<ol class="terms">
							  <li>Once you complete and send me the form, I'll accept or decline your commission.</li>
							  <li>I'll start working and show you the sketch of the commission.</li>
							  <li> Once we made all the changes and you're happy with the sketch, I'll send you an invoice for you to pay.</li>
							  <li>I'll continue working on your commission as soon as I get the payment.</li>
							  <li>I may show you more WIPs between the sketch and finished piece <i>only</i> if there's something I'm unsure about. However, you're allowed to request WIPs of your commission at any time, as long as the requests are at least 72 hours apart from eachother.</li>
							  <li>Once the commission is finished, I'll send you the full size resolution*, and will post a smaller resolution in my galleries and social media accounts during the following days/weeks.</li>
							</ol> 
							
							 * Full size resolution is around A4 at 300dpi (2480 x 3507 pixels). It can be more or less depending on the aspect ratio I see fits the commission. If you want the commission in any specific aspect ratio/resolution, tell me at the beginning of the commission order. Note that resolutions bigger than the one stated can cost an extra fee.<p>
							
						
						<ul class="exp pt30">
								<li><font color="black">Payment</li></font>
						</ul> 
							
							<ul class="terms">
								<li>I'll request full payment at the sketch phase. I will not continue until the payment is received.</li>
								<li>Payment will be done by Paypal invoices only. Once the sketch is approved, I'll send you an invoice to pay. <i>Do not </i>send the money without using the invoice.</li>
								<li>If you fail to pay after a week the invoice was sent without letting me know about the delay beforehand, I have the right to cancel your commission once you make the payment, which will be fully refunded, in case I don't have the time to work on it anymore.</li>
							</ul>
							
						<ul class="exp  pt30">
								<li><font color="black">Usage & Rights</li></font>
						</ul> 
							<ul class="terms">
								<li>You're purchasing a digital file only, no goods will be shipped.</li>
								<li>The commissioner is allowed to use the artwork in any non-commercial way they want. This includes:<br><br>
									
										- Posting it somewhere else as long as it's non-commercial and I'm credited as the artist.<br>
										- Use as signature/avatar/banner on your personal, non profit accounts. In this case, credit is appreciated but not needed.<br>
										- Print it in any kind of merchandising for your personal use only.<br><br>
									
									Commercial use is when the image is used directly or indirectly in a lucrative way. Please note that this includes way more than selling it as merch or directly using it in a project to be sold, so if you're not sure if something falls under personal or commercial usage, please ask me first.</li>
								<li>I retain the copyright of the artwork. This means you're not allowed to modify, copy, trace, use as base, or any other way of stealing.</li>
								<li>I retain the right to post the finished artwork as well as any WIPs in any websites; use it to promote my commissions or myself; and to use any files related to the commission (high resolution, psd file, etc) in profit based websites such as patreon or gumroad and personal commercial artbooks. I will not sell your commission as prints unless you explicitly tell me you're okay with it.
								<br><br>If you're not happy with any of the terms in the previous point, you can request me to waive them by notifying me at the beginning of the commission and adding the following fees to the final commission price:<br><br>
								
								<b>Anonymity - free: </b>I'll post and use the commission as any other, I just won't write your name as the commissioner so you can remain anonymous.<br>

<b>Limited posting - free: </b>You can request the image of the commission I'll be posting online to be a cropped version of the finished commission or to include a bigger watermark. I don't tend to charge an extra fee for this, but if you want me to crop the image <i>a lot</i> of or to add a very intrusive watermark, a small fee may apply. I'll still be able to use the full unwatermarked image in profit based websites or artbooks unless you apply the Non-commercial fee (see below).<br>

<b>Non-commercial fee - 15%:</b> I'll not use your commission in any profit based websites (patreon, gumroad, etc) nor artbooks.<br>

<b>Privacy fee - 40%:</b> I'll not show/use your commission anywhere, digitally or physically. </li>
								
								<li>Once the finished commission was sent and approved, I'm not held responsible if it's deleted from my websites and you didn't have a copy saved or lost it. Download, save and secure a copy for yourself as soon as I send it to you.</li>
								<li>I have the right to reuse unapproved sketches and compositions for other personal art, commissions, or YCH.
(Note: this only applies to sketches and compositions that were asked to redraw in fully, not used in the finished commission or if you cancelled your commission before payment/never paid. I wouldn't be using your character that appears in the sketch, only the pose and composition)</li>
							</ul>
						
						<ul class="exp  pt30">
								<li><font color="black">Revisions</li></font>
						</ul> 
						
						<ul class="terms">
							<li>I'll make only one big revision (as in, completely redoing the sketch) and up to 4 minor revisions in the sketch phase. Once the image is finished, I'll do up to 2 very minor revisions.</li>
							<li>Any revisions done during WIPs after the sketch was approved will count towards the revision limit of the finished image.</li>
							<li>If you want to make any more revisions after said limit, I'll charge an extra fee for each of them depending on the complexity.</li>
							<li>If there's a non subjective mistake that was my own fault (for example: missing a detail from the design), I'll fix it and they won't count towards the revision limit. If the mistake was made because the information you gave me wasn't clear enough, it'll count towards the limit as any other change.</li>
							<li>I have the right to refuse or charge an extra fee if you'd like to make any changes to the finished image after you previously approved it.
(I delete my psd files, so changes may not be possible or may include a lot more work in such situations)</li>
						</ul>
						
						
						<ul class="exp  pt30">
								<li><font color="black">Refund Policy</li></font>
						</ul> 
							 <ul class="terms">
								<li>You are allowed to cancel the commission at any time before payment.</li>
								<li>Once the payment was made, I will not do refunds under any circumstances you come up with. If I have any problems that make me unable to finish your commission within a 3 months time frame after payment was made (very unlikely, never happened yet), I'll offer a full refund, but you're not allowed to ask for them.</li>
								<li>After the commission is finished, there won't be any type of refunds available.</li>
								<li>If you request a Paypal chargeback when you were not allowed to ask for a refund, you'll have none of the aforementioned rights over the commission and I'll have the right to reutilize and profit in any way from the commission.</li>
